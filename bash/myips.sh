# this script accomplishes the task in lab 1 to disply ip addresses for interfaces
# this version is specifically allowed to hardcode the interface names and list
#
# It uses the commands suggested in the exercise instructions
# Sample output:
#   enp0s3: 1.2.3.4
#   External IP: 8.8.8.8
#

# interface name is enp0s3, hardcoded *************
echo -n "enp0s3: "

# this gets any ip addresses from our ifconfig output, hardcoded interface name ***********
ip a s enp0s3|grep 'inet '|awk '{print $2}'|sed 's,/.*,,'
echo -n "External IP: "

# relies on curl being installed and relies on live internet connection
curl icanhazip.com
